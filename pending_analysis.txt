  TOTAL:                            622 items

NOTE: Some items appear in multiple categories where they could reasonably
belong in more than one. The primary categorization was chosen based on
the most common usage pattern observed in the samples.

KEY RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. The parser should be updated to strip Diamond Crystal salt conversion notes
   ("use half as much by volume", "same weight", etc.) - these account for
   ~45+ entries.
2. King Arthur branded products appear frequently (~13 distinct products).
   Consider whether to track these as canonical ingredients or treat them
   as brand-specific variants.
3. Minimalist Baker formatting artifacts (double parentheses with "//" separators,
   "organic when possible", "GF for gluten-free eaters") are a significant
   source of noise - ~30+ entries.
4. Half Baked Harvest URL-embedded ingredients (e.g., "[grilled corn | https://...]")
   should be handled by the parser.
5. Generic category words (nuts, chips, beans, greens, veggies) should be
   blacklisted as they are almost never standalone ingredients.
6. Temperature/prep state words (warmed, pressed, cubed, etc.) are very common
   parsing artifacts and should be stripped during ingredient extraction.
